This is a loan prediction project based on data analytics. Let me be clear here that this code is a more trustworthy source in rejecting a person's loan application rather than approving one,this is beacause it is based on the fact on a person's pattern of spending and history and thus a real life situation can change anytime rather than moving on similar grounds.

About the code:-

The train is the training data set and train1 is the result of clean1 python file
Run the clean and clean1 python files to get the above mentioned datasets.
Run the xgb.py file to get the required output.

Here Xgb stands for X boosted trees.Read about it on google. It is used to boost accuracy of random forest and decision tree algorithms

The id.csv is the data set obtained by separating the ids of loans to be used in the output!

The obtained Accuracy is approximately 81%
